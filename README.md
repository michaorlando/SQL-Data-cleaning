# DATA CLEANING PROJECT IN SQL


This repository showcases my proficiency in data cleaning using SQL. The project focuses on taking a raw dataset and transforming it into a high-quality, ready-for-analysis format.

The project is structured into the following steps:

Duplicate Removal: Techniques like DISTINCT and GROUP BY are employed to identify and eliminate duplicate entries within the dataset.
Data Standardization: Data inconsistencies in formatting (e.g., dates, names) are addressed using string manipulation functions and conditional statements.
Null Value Handling: Strategies for identifying and managing null values are implemented, including deletion, imputation, or flagging.
Column Removal: Columns deemed irrelevant or redundant for further analysis are removed based on data exploration and understanding.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Basic data exploration techniques using functions like AVG, SUM, and window functions are used to understand trends and relationships within the cleaned data.
